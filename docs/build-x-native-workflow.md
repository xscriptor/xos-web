# Native Package Manager Workflow (Pending)

This document preserves the former `build-x-native.yml` workflow. It is kept for
future reference and is **not** used right now.

## Status

- **Pending**: to be re-enabled when the native package manager (`xpm`/`xpkg`)
  is ready for production.
- Packages for the `[x]` pacman repository are currently built locally and
  committed to `public/repo/x86_64/`. See `build-packages.sh`.
- The website deploy workflow (`build.yml`) publishes the committed files to
  GitHub Pages without rebuilding packages.

## Original Workflow

Name: Build X Native Repo & Deploy Web

Triggers on `workflow_dispatch`. It builds native `.xp` packages from source
(`xpm`, `xpkg`, `xfetch`, `xclock`), publishes them to `public/x/x86_64/`,
and deploys the website to GitHub Pages.

## Notes

- Both the native workflow and the website workflow deploy to GitHub Pages.
- Do not re-enable this workflow while the website deploy workflow is active,
  or they may overwrite each other's Pages deployment.
