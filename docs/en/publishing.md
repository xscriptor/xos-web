# Publishing a Package

Publishing to the `[x]` pacman repository is a **local build then commit** flow.
GitHub Actions never builds packages; it only deploys what is committed under
`public/` (see [web-portal.md](web-portal.md)).

The full cycle: local build -> `repo-add` -> `SHA256SUMS` -> PR -> Pages deploy.

## 1. Local build

Requirements: an Arch-like environment with `makepkg` and `repo-add` available.

### Package built from a PKGBUILD in this repo

Work on the package source, then build it inside its directory exactly as
`build-packages.sh` does:

```bash
cd packages/x-release      # or packages/x-dev
makepkg -cf --noconfirm
```

This produces a `.pkg.tar.zst` (e.g. `x-release-1.0-8-any.pkg.tar.zst`) inside the
package directory.

### External package (x-scripts)

`x-scripts` is built in the sibling `scripts` repo (its `PKGBUILD` lives at
`scripts/packaging/`), not here. Build it there and import the resulting tarball so
the repo regeneration picks it up — either drop it under a `packages/*/` directory or
place it directly in `public/repo/x86_64/` before running the script. There is no
`packages/x-scripts/` source directory in this repo.

### Native .xp packages (xpm/xpkg path)

The `.xp` endpoint under `public/x/x86_64/` is out of scope for this flow: the
automated native workflow is disabled and kept for reference in
`docs/build-x-native-workflow.md`.

## 2. Regenerate the repository (repo-add)

From the repository root run:

```bash
./build-packages.sh
```

The script:

1. Rebuilds the configured PKGBUILD packages (`x-release`, `x-dev`) with `makepkg`.
2. Copies every `packages/*/*.pkg.tar.zst` into `public/repo/x86_64/` and deletes the
   build artifacts.
3. Regenerates the pacman database from every tarball in the directory:

   ```bash
   repo-add -n -R x.db.tar.gz *.pkg.tar.zst
   cp x.db.tar.gz x.db
   cp x.files.tar.gz x.files
   sha256sum * > SHA256SUMS
   ```

Do not edit `x.db` or `SHA256SUMS` by hand; always regenerate them with this script
(contributing rules in `CONTRIBUTING.md` also forbid manual database edits).

## 3. Review and commit

Check what changed under `public/repo/x86_64/`:

```bash
git status
git diff --stat
```

Expected changes for a package update:

- the new `.pkg.tar.zst` (and removal of the replaced version),
- regenerated `x.db`, `x.db.tar.gz`, `x.files`, `x.files.tar.gz`,
- regenerated `SHA256SUMS`,
- the `PKGBUILD` change itself under `packages/`.

Commit the repository changes, for example:

```bash
git add packages/x-release public/repo/x86_64
git commit -m "publish x-release 1.0-8"
```

## 4. Pull request

Per `CONTRIBUTING.md` the contribution flow is fork, branch, pull request against the
`main` branch. Maintainers can also commit to a working branch and open the PR
directly. Merge to `main` once CI/validation passes.

## 5. Deploy to GitHub Pages

After the changes are on `main`, deploy the site so the new repository files go live:

1. Go to the **Actions** tab of `xlnux/x-repo`.
2. Run the **"Deploy Website to GitHub Pages"** workflow (`build.yml`) manually via
   `workflow_dispatch`.
3. The workflow runs `npm ci && npm run build` (static export of the Next.js site
   including everything from `public/`), sanity-checks that `x.db` and an
   `x-release` tarball exist, then uploads `./out` to GitHub Pages.

The updated packages are now served at:

- `https://xlnux.github.io/x-repo/repo/x86_64/` (pacman `[x]` repo)

### Caveats

- Do not run two Pages deployment workflows at once; they would overwrite each
  other's deployment (a `pages` concurrency group is defined in `build.yml`, and
  `docs/build-x-native-workflow.md` warns the same for the native workflow, which is
  disabled).
- Keep the repository in sync with its consumers: `x-release` and `x-dev` are
  installed from this repo during the X distro install, and `x-scripts` must match
  the payload revision expected by the installer.
